In the fast-paced and densely populated world we live in, people are increasingly seeking ways to streamline their lives and make daily tasks more efficient. Fortunately, advancements in technology have led to significant developments that have simplified various aspects of our lives. These developments have made certain tasks easier and more convenient than they were in the past, allowing people to save time and effort.

In this project we decided to apply software engineering principles to meet human's needs and facilitate means of entertainment, so we bring you an application that facilitates your hangout to the Cinema.

The system’s main purpose is to facilitate the movie hunters’ needs. It enables them to view today’s available movies, seats, and time and to ensure them that they will be able to book a ticket without worrying about the tickets being sold out. In addition, this system should be viewed from the administrator’s point of view which means that this administrator will be able to add/delete movies and view the booking history of the client.
